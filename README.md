#### Community Food Stall Sharing App
* Users can upload photos of their community food stall to update other users on the current offerings.
* Users to take a photo if any changes have been made on the food stall, i.e. if the user has added or taken food, or if a user has noticed that the latest photo is not up-to-date.
* The goal is to allow users to get a snapshot of what's in the community food stall without needing to walk or drive to it or having to repeatedly post on social media.
* This will save time for the users, allow for a more collaborative management of the food stall, and decrease food waste by making it easier for users to know when there is new food available.
